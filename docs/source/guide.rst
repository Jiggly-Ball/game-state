Guide
=====

To get started with this library, you need to first create a new project, create
a virtual environment & activate it (optional but recommended). Once you've done
that you may continue.

Installation
------------

Installing ``game_state`` through pip-

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install game_state

Since ``game_state`` does not have any dependancies, we need to manually install
the pygame library (or it's forks) too.

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install pygame

Creating a Screen

.. code-block:: python

   import pygame
   

.. :toctree::
